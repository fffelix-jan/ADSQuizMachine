 Used to study ZJU Advanced Data Structures true/false questions.

The program is written in C# using WinForms for the GUI. You will need to use the latest version of Visual Studio with the .NET Framework development tools installed to be able to compile it.

I don't feel like writing too long of a description since I think the code should be self-explanatory enough.

To add questions, fork this project, create a new folder in the `questions` folder with a name starting with `tfq_` and place the question content in `index.html` and the answer in `answer.txt` (which can either be `1` for true or `0` for false). Then, submit a pull request. Thanks for your help!
